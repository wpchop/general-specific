Sentence: 0In a major shift within the MUCH-CRITICIZED(2) $ 18.4 billion program to rebuild Iraq 's physical infrastructure , the office that the Pentagon formed to oversee the effort will begin handing ITS(2) RESPONSIBILITIES(2) over to the United States Army Corps of Engineers over the next several months .

Sentence: 1Charles Hess , the director of the agency , the Project and Contracting Office , said in a telephone interview from Baghdad that the CHANGE(2) was a NATURAL(2) EVOLUTION(2) .

Sentence: 2HE(2) denied that the MOVE(2) was a response to Iraqi and American criticism that the RECONSTRUCTION(2) EFFORT(2) had focused too much on LARGE(2) PROJECTS(2) , started up too slowly and failed to anticipate attacks by insurgents .

Sentence: 3As the United States tries to LAY(1) THE(1) GROUNDWORK(1) for a functioning Iraqi government before elections on Jan. 30 , SOME(1) CRITICISMS(1) of the reconstruction program have carried a particular sting : a major goal of the reconstruction , from power plants and sewage-treatment plants to roads and fire stations , was to PERSUADE(1) ORDINARY(1) IRAQIS(1) OF(1) THE(1) GOOD(1) WILL(1) AND(1) COMPETENCE(1) OF(1) THE(1) POST-SADDAM(1) HUSSEIN(1) AUTHORITIES(1) .

Sentence: 4While the Army corps has increased electricity output and BOTH(2) AGENCIES(2) have put in place other , SMALLER-SCALE(2) PROJECTS(2) , most MAJOR(2) EFFORTS(2) have faced MAJOR(2) DELAYS(2) .

Sentence: 5Insurgent attacks have hit both the PROJECTS(3) and the workers , prompting SOME(3) LARGE(3) COMPANIES(3) to pull out of Iraq , sending security costs skyrocketing and forcing the elimination or scaling down of dozens of projects .

Sentence: 6Mr. Hess defended the RECONSTRUCTION(2) program as successful , given the HARD(2) REALITIES(2) of Iraq , and said the gradual shift of responsibility to the Army corps , with its history of managing construction project in conflict zones , had LONG(2) BEEN(2) ENVISIONED(2) .

Sentence: 7But Rick Barton , co-director of the post-conflict reconstruction program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , said the SHIFT(3) '' is a further confirmation that the PLACE(3) is n't safe . '' ''

Sentence: 8I assume that the Army corps feels better about going places that are just plain dangerous , '' HE(3) said .

Sentence: 9The corps has largely avoided the criticism that has dogged the PROJECT(3) office .
