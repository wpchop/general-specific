2005_01_20_1643450.20	Insurgents detonated five powerful truck and car bombs across Baghdad on Wednesday , killing 26 people , at least 9 of them members of Iraq 's fledgling security forces . The attacks came as Iraq 's interim prime minister , Ayad Allawi , said he would reveal plans next week for an accelerated buildup of those forces to prepare for an eventual American withdrawal . Responding to political pressures within Iraq ahead of the Jan. 30 elections and mounting questions in Washington about the prospects for an American pullout , Dr. Allawi said he had been talking with the United States commanders in Baghdad about ways to accelerate the '' training , equipping and deploying '' of Iraqi security forces . He added that '' this in turn will accelerate the drawdown and gradual withdrawal of the multinational forces in Iraq . '' Those forces are made up of about 150,000 troops from the United States and upward of 25,000 from other nations . But Dr. Allawi raised the tantalizing prospect of an eventual American withdrawal while giving little away , insisting that a pullout could not be tied to a fixed timetable , but rather to the Iraqi forces ' progress toward standing on their own . That formula is similar to what President Bush and other senior administration officials have spoken about . Some American military commanders have said privately that with this approach and considering the demoralization , desertion and unwillingness to fight common among Iraqi forces trained so far , American troops could be tied down for years , unless elections or other political developments bring the war to an unexpected end . '' I will be explaining this carefully planned process -- what I call a ` conditions based ' rather than a ` calendar based ' gradual withdrawal program , in more detail next week , '' Dr. Allawi told reporters at a ceremony at Baghdad airport . He was there to accept the first of three C-130 military transport planes that Iraq is to receive as part of the American-financed buildup of Iraqi forces . The aircraft was the first large plane acquired by the new Iraqi Air Force , which was one of the most powerful in the Middle East before it was decimated by bombing attacks in the 1991 Persian Gulf war . Dr. Allawi 's remarks were made on a day when attacks underlined , once again , how insurgents have turned wide areas of the country , including Baghdad , into what is effectively enemy territory , with an ability to strike almost at will , and to shake off the losses inflicted by American troops . The attacks in Baghdad on Wednesday were aimed at the approaches to the Australian Embassy and four Iraqi security targets , including a police station , an army garrison and a bank where policemen were lining up to receive their monthly pay . The attacks , four of them within 90 minutes in the morning rush hour , rattled windows and doors miles away . Spread across a wide area of the city , they wounded dozens of people , most of them Iraqi civilians , in addition to those killed , and served as a reminder of the insurgents ' power to spread mayhem across the capital only 11 days before the elections . American commanders have sought to prepare public opinion in Iraq and abroad for one of the bloodiest chapters in the war so far , saying the escalation of violence promised by the insurgents can be diminished to a degree , but not prevented , by an increasing tempo of American military raids on insurgent groups . The American hope is that the voting , for a national assembly and provincial councils , will help turn the tide by drawing a strong turnout among more than 14 million eligible voters , despite the threat of attacks by Sunni insurgents on polling stations , candidates and voters , and a boycott of the election being urged by powerful figures in regions where Iraq 's Sunni minority population predominates . In almost any foreseeable outcome of the election , the Sunnis face the prospect , for the first time in centuries , of ceding political power in Baghdad to the country 's 60 percent Shiite majority . Wednesday 's deadliest attack occurred near a police station and Al Alahi hospital in the Alwiyah district of eastern Baghdad . The American command said a suicide car bomber killed 18 people , including 5 Iraqi policemen , and that 15 other people had been wounded .
