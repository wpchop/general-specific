It was like time forgot them . '' Hard to forget , however , was the price : just $ 2 apiece . '' Half of it 's the hunt , and the other half 's finding that really great deal , '' said Ms. Costales , a stay-at-home mother and manager of investment property . These days , the growing popularity of collecting and wearing vintage clothing has made those $ 2 deals harder to come by , as shoppers become as knowledgeable about top designers as retailers and wholesalers . '' Some vintage shop owners , if they 're going to the same estate sales , wo n't share information because you , the shopper , are their competition , '' said Ms. Costales , who gave the $ 2 suits to her older sister .

Just over a year ago , on my last visit to the country , I was able to drive north to Tikrit , Saddam Hussein 's home town , and south to the Shiite holy city of Najaf . These were not excursions for sitting back and enjoying the scenery . But they were feasible , at high speed and with some risk . Today , no Westerner with any vestige of sanity would contemplate making such trips , even in the aftermath of an election that was a remarkable success .

It is that , by any rational assessment , the danger is unacceptable .
