2005_01_14_1641845.20	In a major shift within the much-criticized $ 18.4 billion program to rebuild Iraq 's physical infrastructure , the office that the Pentagon formed to oversee the effort will begin handing its responsibilities over to the United States Army Corps of Engineers over the next several months . Charles Hess , the director of the agency , the Project and Contracting Office , said in a telephone interview from Baghdad that the change was a natural evolution . He denied that the move was a response to Iraqi and American criticism that the reconstruction effort had focused too much on large projects , started up too slowly and failed to anticipate attacks by insurgents . As the United States tries to lay the groundwork for a functioning Iraqi government before elections on Jan. 30 , some criticisms of the reconstruction program have carried a particular sting : a major goal of the reconstruction , from power plants and sewage-treatment plants to roads and fire stations , was to persuade ordinary Iraqis of the good will and competence of the post-Saddam Hussein authorities . While the Army corps has increased electricity output and both agencies have put in place other , smaller-scale projects , most major efforts have faced major delays . Insurgent attacks have hit both the projects and the workers , prompting some large companies to pull out of Iraq , sending security costs skyrocketing and forcing the elimination or scaling down of dozens of projects . Mr. Hess defended the reconstruction program as successful , given the hard realities of Iraq , and said the gradual shift of responsibility to the Army corps , with its history of managing construction project in conflict zones , had long been envisioned . But Rick Barton , co-director of the post-conflict reconstruction program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , said the shift '' is a further confirmation that the place is n't safe . '' '' I assume that the Army corps feels better about going places that are just plain dangerous , '' he said . The corps has largely avoided the criticism that has dogged the project office . The corps has had a much lower profile and has enjoyed some construction successes in Iraq . Its electrical projects have added more than 1,800 megawatts to the Iraqi grid , roughly the equivalent of two large power plants . But major corps projects , like huge waterway projects in the United States , have also been criticized as grandiose and unresponsive to local needs . And it was the Army corps that awarded Halliburton an early no-bid contract worth billions of dollars for work on Iraq 's oil fields , which opened the company to lashing criticism . Whether the corps will fare better than the project office is open to question , Mr. Barton said . Success in Iraq means engaging the local populace , he said , and '' that has n't been their strength even domestically . '' Brig. Gen. Thomas Bostick , commander of the Army corps in the Persian Gulf region , said that because the two organizations had been working hand-in-glove from the start , he did not regard the switch as a substantial change . Rather , he said , the project office , with its emphasis on planning , will slim down as more contracts moved into construction . '' I see this as a natural progression , '' General Bostick said . '' To say it 's going to change , and is going to change as a result of negative perception , is not correct . ''	["I see this as a natural progression , '' General Bostick said . ''", "To say it 's going to change , and is going to change as a result of negative perception , is not correct . ''"]	["The contracting office and the projects it finances employ about 155 government workers in Baghdad and the United States , about 250 contractors in Iraq and just over 100,000 Iraqis who work on the construction itself .", "The contracting office said that 1,550 projects were currently under way , and that $ 2.4 billion had been spent , out of $ 13.95 billion committed specifically to reconstruction .", "( Some of the original $ 18.4 billion allocated by Congress has gone to the training of Iraqi security forces and other projects unrelated to construction . )", "The planned changes have not been disclosed publicly , but they have been discussed in staff meetings since at least September .", "Two former officials at the project office said that uncertainty over exactly who would be in charge of various projects had caused morale problems among some members of a staff that is already coping with work in an extremely dangerous place far from home .", "But one of the former officials said that by preventing the project office from becoming a permanent government institution , there was also a positive slant to the shift . ''", "This bureaucracy had n't settled in , '' the former official said . ''", "Everything was n't static .", "In some ways that was a benefit . ''", "Even with the changes , it is unlikely that the project office will vanish entirely over the next year , because some projects are still in the planning stages and because moving the dozens of government employees into new jobs will be a major task in itself ."]

2005_01_25_1644798.10	Just weeks after losing his world-famous winery , Robert Mondavi is going back into the wine business , briefly , with a surprising partner -- his brother Peter . It will be a small venture . But it will be the first public collaboration of the two nonagenarians since a legendary dispute some 40 years ago that prompted Robert to split with his family and start his own business . Together , Robert , 92 , and Peter , 90 , will produce a small barrel of wine -- 60 magnums to be exact -- to be sold next summer at the Napa Valley Auction , the California wine world 's premier social event . The lighthearted venture , arranged by the brothers ' winemaking sons , is heavy with symbolism , coming as it does so soon after the implosion of the Robert Mondavi Winery and its subsequent sale to Constellation Brands late last year for about $ 1 billion . It represents a formal healing of a breach that kept the two branches of the renowned wine family apart for almost half a century and it represents , too , a recognition that while the two factions may have stood for different ways of winemaking , they were in the long run , not as far apart as they once had thought . For the first time since his teenage years , Robert Mondavi has no formal connection to a winery . For his brother it is a vindication of sorts of his quieter style of running a major winery , in this case , the Charles Krug Winery , just up the road from the Robert Mondavi Winery in the Napa Valley . The Mondavi brothers ' father , Cesare , a grape shipper in the Central Valley , bought Charles Krug in 1943 for his sons to run . The sons bickered over how to run the business , culminating in the 1965 altercation .
