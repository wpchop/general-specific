Sentence 0: The people of California knew exactly what(1/1) I(1/1) stood(2/2) for(1/1) and said to me , ` Barbara , go and be a truth(1/1) teller(1/1) , '' ' she said in an interview after the hearings(3/3) .

Sentence 1: The exchanges between the(1/1) two(1/1) accomplished(1/1) women(2/2) -- '' she 's a very good(1/1) debater and I 'm a pretty good debater , and that 's interesting , '' the senator(1/1) said -- marked some of the most compelling(1/1) moments during hearings(1/1) that had a certain(1/1) outcome(2/2) , since Ms. Rice 's confirmation(2/2) was never(1/1) in doubt .

Sentence 2: Even so , the publicity that their(3/3) sharp(1/1) exchanges attracted may have helped persuade the Democrats to demand on Wednesday a debate on the nomination(2/2) on the Senate floor as well , which would delay the confirmation(1/1) vote(1/1) until next week .

Sentence 3: Republicans privately accused her(3/3) of grandstanding(1/1) and playing to the party(1/1) 's left wing , but conceded(1/1) that that was her prerogative(1/1) .

Sentence 4: Supporters of Ms. Rice said Ms. Boxer had inflicted(1/1) no damage on the(1/1) nominee(1/1) , who on Tuesday cautioned(1/1) the senator about '' impugning my integrity . ''

Sentence 5: Democratic colleagues said they had no doubt about the(1/1) Californian(3/3) 's sincerity(2/2) . ''

Sentence 6: I do n't(1/1) always agree(1/1) with her , '' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York , who has known Ms.(1/1) Boxer(1/1) since she was elected to the House in 1982 . ''

Sentence 7: But(2/2) she(2/2) is wholly genuine(1/1) .

Sentence 8: She(2/2) really(1/1) believes what(1/1) she says .

Sentence 9: She(2/2) feels it(2/2) strongly(1/1) .

Sentence 0: While the little Seahawks flying off the deck of the Abraham Lincoln carried modest(1/1) loads(1/1) , six giant Chinooks , provided by the Singapore Armed Forces with little fanfare , did a good deal of the heavy lifting : when a cargo plane ran into a water buffalo and blocked the landing strip at Banda Aceh , it was a Chinook that lowered the earth-moving machinery that shoved the plane out of the way .

Sentence 1: Singapore is , by tradition , a hard-power(1/1) country , though its stature is not military but economic ( which Nye(1/1) recognizes as a third(1/1) , autonomous dimension of power ) .

Sentence 2: When I stopped off there(3/3) on my way home , a friend said to me , '' The irony(1/1) is that Lee Kuan Yew would never have done this(3/3) . ''

Sentence 3: The(1/1) tough-minded(2/2) former(1/1) prime(2/2) minister(2/2) thought , like Donald(1/1) Rumsfeld(1/1) seems to think , that charitable(1/1) gestures(1/1) were for sissies .

Sentence 4: But Lee(1/1) 's very new successor(1/1) , Lee Hsien Loong , has publicly committed Singapore to the task of rehabilitating(2/2) the(1/1) region(3/3) .

Sentence 5: The United States will never(1/1) win as much gratitude(2/2) as(1/1) feisty(1/1) little Singapore .

Sentence 6: And in the age of global terrorism , our soldiers must always be prepared to fight .

Sentence 7: At the moment , in fact , the war in Iraq has put(1/1) a(1/1) huge(1/1) strain(1/1) on our forces .

Sentence 8: But reducing that(2/2) commitment(2/2) will make other(1/1) choices(1/1) possible .

Sentence 9: The need to respond to another(2/2) epic(1/1) disaster(1/1) will(1/1) not(1/1) , God willing , come along for a good many years ; if we are to continue to deploy(1/1) our hard-power resources in soft-power settings , it will mostly take the more familiar form of peacekeeping .

Sentence 0: In an(1/1) interview(1/1) yesterday , Peter Mondavi Jr. said the(1/1) breach(3/3) between his(1/1) father(1/1) and his uncle had(1/1) been(1/1) closing(2/2) slowly(1/1) in recent(1/1) years(1/1) .

Sentence 1: He(3/3) said the one-time joint winemaking venture(1/1) was meant in(1/1) part(1/1) to show family solidarity(1/1) in the light of his(1/1) uncle(1/1) 's(1/1) recent(2/2) reverses(3/3) .

Sentence 2: He(3/3) also said that Krug(1/1) , which is entirely family owned and run by his father , his brother Mark and himself , is just completing a $ 20 million renovation(1/1) and expansion , all of it financed internally .

Sentence 3: There was never(1/1) any(1/1) thought(1/1) of a public(1/1) offering(1/1) to(1/1) raise(2/2) cash(3/3) , he(1/1) said , a pointed reference to Robert Mondavi 's public(1/1) issue(2/2) in the 1990 's and that(1/1) winery(1/1) 's subsequent and ultimately(1/1) unsuccessful(1/1) struggle to satisfy stockholder expectations .

Sentence 4: With over 850 acres of vineyards , the Krug winery -- which has no connections with Krug Champagne in France , is one(1/1) of(1/1) the(1/1) largest(2/2) land(1/1) owners(1/1) in the Napa Valley .

Sentence 5: Its(3/3) business is divided into two parts , one producing inexpensive(1/1) wines under the CK Mondavi label , the other concentrating on high-end(1/1) wines .

Sentence 6: Peter(1/1) Mondavi(1/1) Jr.(1/1) said he and his cousin , Tim , Robert 's younger son , would make the(2/2) wine(2/2) , each contributing half a barrel from their cellars .

Sentence 7: Tim Mondavi was his father 's chief winemaker before the(1/1) sale(3/3) .

Sentence 8: Both(2/2) branches(2/2) of(2/2) the(2/2) family(3/3) were represented at a dinner in New York last night given by Wine Enthusiast Magazine to honor Mel(1/1) Dick(1/1) , a prominent distributor .

Sentence 9: Tim(1/1) Mondavi(1/1) , standing with his cousin Peter at the(1/1) dinner(1/1) , said of his(1/1) family(2/2) 's(2/2) problems(3/3) : '' We did n't want it to happen , but it happened .

Sentence 0: Recounting his abduction(1/1) , the(1/1) archbishop(1/1) said he was coming home from work on Monday evening , just around dusk , when a car suddenly blocked the road in front of him and gunmen(1/1) jumped out .

Sentence 1: Insurgents(1/2) grabbed(1/1) the 66-year-old archbishop and stuffed(1/1) him in the trunk(1/1) . ''

Sentence 2: I thought these(1/1) were the(1/1) last(1/1) minutes(1/1) of(1/1) my(1/1) life(1/1) , '' he(2/2) said .

Sentence 3: He(3/3) said the insurgents kept(1/1) asking(1/1) the(1/1) same(1/1) question(1/1) : Are you an American spy ? ''

Sentence 4: I told them(2/2) , you(1/1) do not know me , '' he(3/3) said . ''

Sentence 5: We(3/3) are Christians , and we believe the Americans are occupiers(1/1) . ''

Sentence 6: The archbishop(1/1) was released(2/2) Tuesday morning .

Sentence 7: The eight Chinese workers are still missing(2/2) , and the only clue to their whereabouts is a hazy video(1/1) shot in front of a(1/1) brick(1/1) wall(1/1) and broadcast Tuesday on several Arab television channels .

Sentence 8: The(1/1) insurgents(1/1) said in a statement that the(2/2) Chinese(2/2) men(2/2) were working for the American military and demanded that the Chinese government , which has stayed relatively(1/1) quiet on the issue of Iraq , declare its opinion of the occupation(1/1) .

Sentence 9: Mr. Naqib , the interior minister , talking about insurgent attacks , said that from the(1/1) beginning(2/2) there has been a conspiracy to undermine(2/2) the rebuilding of Iraq , and that it may only(1/1) get(2/3) worse(3/4) . ''

Sentence 0: '' WHAT stresses me most , '' the chief executive of Novartis(1/1) , Daniel L. Vasella , said , '' is that we are getting new regulations(3/3) from abroad(1/1) without any consultation(2/2) . ''

Sentence 1: This(3/3) has been the World Economic Forum that the United States government largely passed(3/3) by(3/3) .

Sentence 2: In a world that both respects and fears American power , there is worry(1/1) that the United States does not care what others think(1/1) .

Sentence 3: Or(1/1) , as Tony Blair , the prime minister of Britain , put it in a speech to the forum(2/2) , '' If America wants the rest of the world to be part of the agenda(1/1) it has set , it must be part of their agenda , too . ''

Sentence 4: He(3/3) added(2/2) , '' What people(2/2) want is not for America to concede(2/2) , but for America to engage(1/1) . ''

Sentence 5: It is a fair(1/1) bet that Mr. Blair has given(1/1) little(2/2) thought(1/1) to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley(1/1) Act(1/1) or to the(1/1) way(1/1) the Securities and Exchange Commission can adjust(1/1) accounting(1/1) rules(2/2) , which is what concerns(1/1) Mr. Vasella .

Sentence 6: Mr.(1/1) Blair(1/1) was more(1/1) concerned(1/1) with global(1/1) warming(1/1) and(1/1) world(1/1) poverty(1/1) .

Sentence 7: The twin American deficits(2/2) figured into concerns(1/1) that the United States would do(1/1) as(1/1) it(1/1) pleases(1/1) regardless of the possible impact on the world economy . ''

Sentence 8: I do n't see the budget(1/1) deficit(3/3) being dealt(1/1) with(2/2) , '' said Jacob Frenkel , the former head of Israel 's central bank and now a vice chairman of the American International Group , a large insurance company . ''

Sentence 9: I(2/2) am concerned with the U.S. current-account(1/1) deficit(1/1) , not because it can not be dealt with but because of the(1/1) way(1/1) it is not being dealt with . ''

Sentence 0: [ In a suicide(1/1) car-bombing(2/2) early Wednesday , Reuters(2/2) reported , two people were killed near the Australian Embassy in Baghdad .

Sentence 1: A(2/2) few(2/2) minutes(2/2) later(2/2) , a second suicide car-bombing(1/1) killed six people near a police building in the north-central area of the(1/1) city(3/3) , Agence France-Presse reported . ]

Sentence 2: Elsewhere(1/1) , an American soldier(1/1) was(1/1) killed(2/2) in western(1/1) Iraq(1/1) , the(1/1) military(2/2) said Tuesday .

Sentence 3: Also on Tuesday , news(1/1) agencies(1/1) reported that gunmen recently(1/1) killed three political candidates(1/1) in different parts of the(2/2) country(3/3) , and the government announced that it was closing the borders during the election , except for Muslim pilgrims returning from Saudi Arabia .

Sentence 4: -------------------- 3 Britons on Trial in Abuse Case ( By The New York Times ) , LONDON , Jan. 16 -- The British Army opened(1/1) court-martial(1/1) proceedings against three soldiers accused of abusing(2/2) Iraqi prisoners who were thought to have(1/1) stolen(3/3) from a British base near Basra in May 2003 .

Sentence 5: The(1/1) court(1/1) , at a British military base in Osnabrück , Germany , was shown photographs taken(1/1) by five British soldiers of Iraqis , often naked , forced(1/1) to simulate sexual acts and being beaten or mistreated .

Sentence 6: British news reports(1/1) likened(1/1) the(1/1) incidents(3/3) to abuse by American soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad .

Sentence 7: One of the soldiers(2/2) on(1/1) trial(2/2) , Lance Cpl. Darren Larkin , admitted assaulting(1/1) an unidentified man at the(1/1) base(3/3) .

Sentence 8: The two other(2/2) soldiers(1/1) , Cpl. Daniel Kenyon and Lance Cpl. Mark Cooley , denied all the(1/1) charges(3/3) .

Sentence 0: Insurgents detonated five powerful(2/2) truck and car bombs across Baghdad on Wednesday , killing 26 people , at least 9 of them members of Iraq 's fledgling(2/2) security forces .

Sentence 1: The(1/1) attacks(3/3) came as Iraq 's interim prime minister , Ayad Allawi , said he would reveal plans next week for an accelerated buildup of those(2/2) forces(2/2) to prepare for an eventual American withdrawal .

Sentence 2: Responding to political(2/2) pressures(3/3) within Iraq ahead of the Jan. 30 elections and mounting(1/1) questions(1/1) in Washington about the prospects for an American pullout , Dr. Allawi said he had been talking with the United States commanders in Baghdad about ways(1/1) to accelerate the '' training , equipping and deploying '' of Iraqi security forces .

Sentence 3: He(2/2) added(1/1) that '' this(3/3) in turn will accelerate the drawdown and gradual withdrawal of the multinational(1/1) forces(1/1) in Iraq . ''

Sentence 4: Those(2/2) forces(2/2) are made up of about 150,000 troops from the United States and upward of 25,000 from other(2/2) nations(1/1) .

Sentence 5: But Dr. Allawi raised the tantalizing(1/1) prospect of an eventual American withdrawal(1/1) while giving little(1/1) away(1/1) , insisting that a pullout(1/1) could(1/1) not(1/1) be tied to a fixed timetable , but rather to the Iraqi forces ' progress toward standing(1/1) on(1/1) their(1/1) own(1/1) .

Sentence 6: That(2/2) formula(2/2) is similar(2/2) to what(1/1) President Bush and other(1/1) senior(1/1) administration(1/1) officials(1/1) have spoken(1/1) about .

Sentence 7: Some(2/2) American(1/1) military(1/1) commanders(1/1) have said privately that with this(2/2) approach(2/2) and considering the demoralization , desertion and unwillingness to fight common among Iraqi forces trained so far , American troops could be tied(2/2) down(2/2) for years , unless elections or other political developments bring the war(1/1) to an unexpected end . ''

Sentence 8: I will be explaining this carefully(1/1) planned(1/1) process(2/2) -- what I call a ` conditions based ' rather than a ` calendar based ' gradual withdrawal(2/2) program(1/1) , in more detail next week , '' Dr. Allawi told reporters at a(2/2) ceremony(2/2) at Baghdad airport .

Sentence 9: He(3/3) was there(2/2) to accept the first of three C-130 military transport planes that Iraq is to receive as part of the American-financed buildup(1/1) of Iraqi forces .

Sentence 0: It is difficult(1/1) to understand why we would use U.S. tax dollars to fund the(1/1) further(1/1) development(1/1) of foreign helicopter technology , '' he(2/2) said .

Sentence 1: Mr. Young said that two-thirds of the work on the(3/3) new(2/2) helicopters(2/2) would take place in the United States , with the rest split between Italy and Britain .

Sentence 2: AgustaWestland(1/1) is a subsidiary of the Italian firm(1/1) , Finmeccanica(1/1) .

Sentence 3: Several crucial components of the(2/2) craft(2/2) , including the transmission and rotor blades , will be built overseas(3/3) .

Sentence 4: Lockheed itself will serve as a systems-integrator for the(3/3) craft(2/2) , and provide all the(1/1) technical components and computers to connect it to the rest of the world .

Sentence 5: The helicopter chosen(2/2) by the Pentagon , called the US 101 , is a variation(2/2) of one already in use by the British Royal Navy ; it has been purchased by several other European countries and it is used to ferry the Pope .

Sentence 6: What swayed the Pentagon to Lockheed(1/1) , Mr. Young said , was the fact that the(1/1) US(2/2) 101(2/2) has a larger(1/1) cabin , can carry a heavier(1/1) payload and could be put into service(1/1) faster(1/1) than Sikorsky 's offering , the VH-92 .

Sentence 7: The(1/1) US(2/2) 101(2/2) uses three engines , while(1/1) the VH-92 has two .

Sentence 8: To(1/1) some(2/2) extent(1/1) , the details of all the security measures incorporated in the(1/1) helicopter fleet are so sensitive that it is impossible for outsiders(1/1) to analyze each(1/1) company(1/1) 's offerings against the Pentagon 's requirements(1/1) , said Loren B. Thompson , a military industry analyst at the Lexington Institute , a northern Virginia research group that monitors government spending . ''

Sentence 9: The government will never(1/1) release to the public a list of the(1/1) requirements(1/1) for this(3/3) craft(2/2) , '' Mr. Thompson said . ''

Sentence 0: After a(1/1) contest(2/2) that had pitted(1/1) domestic pride against global politics , the Pentagon yesterday chose an international team , headed by Lockheed Martin , to build the next fleet of presidential helicopters over Sikorsky Aircraft , which had positioned itself as the '' all-American '' choice .

Sentence 1: In selecting(1/1) Lockheed , which will receive $ 1.7 billion initially to begin the(2/2) program(2/2) , the Pentagon signaled a new openness to foreign partners on sensitive military tasks .

Sentence 2: By doing(1/1) so(1/1) , it(3/3) also rewarded(1/1) Britain and Italy , two of the United States ' staunchest allies in the Iraq War .

Sentence 3: The(1/1) helicopter(1/1) fleet(2/2) , which will be ready in 2009 , will be built by a joint venture of Lockheed and AgustaWestland , a British-Italian venture that designed much(1/1) of the helicopter and will make about a third of it .

Sentence 4: John Young , the assistant Navy secretary who made the(1/1) announcement(2/2) , argued that politics played no role in the selection(3/3) .

Sentence 5: But it(3/3) was immediately denounced as '' outrageously wrong(2/2) '' by Senator Joseph Lieberman , a Connecticut Democrat , who lobbied strongly for Sikorsky to continue(1/1) building the White House 's helicopters , a role that dates back to the Eisenhower(1/1) era(1/1) .

Sentence 6: Sikorsky(3/3) , a subsidiary of United Technologies , is based in Connecticut .

Sentence 7: New York 's Congressional delegation , by(1/1) contrast(3/3) , lined up with the Lockheed group , supporting it because some of the(1/1) work(2/2) will be done at a new Lockheed plant in upstate New York .

Sentence 8: The $ 6.1 billion contract -- $ 3.6 billion for the fleet of 23 helicopters and the rest for research(1/1) and(1/1) development(1/1) -- is far from the Pentagon 's largest(2/2) .

Sentence 9: But it(3/3) is full of symbolic value(1/1) and was seen as a critical test of the Pentagon 's willingness to do business with foreign military companies . ''

Sentence 0: In his 2002 book , '' The Paradox of American Power , '' Joseph S. Nye Jr. , the scholar(1/1) and former Pentagon official , famously(2/2) distinguishes(2/2) between '' hard '' and '' soft '' power .

Sentence 1: The(1/1) first(3/3) is the power to coerce(1/1) , largely through military might ; the(1/1) second(3/3) , the power to co-opt through such '' intangible '' factors as culture , values and institutions ( the media , churches , schools and so forth ) .

Sentence 2: In an era of globalized(1/1) information(1/1) , Nye observes , the power to persuade has become almost as important as the power to compel , and he criticizes American policy makers for their single-minded focus(1/1) on brute(1/1) force(1/1) .

Sentence 3: Where , in this(1/1) taxonomy(3/3) , do we put the images we saw in recent weeks of United States Navy helicopter pilots aboard the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln ferrying supplies(1/1) to victims of the tsunami in the Indonesian province of Aceh ?

Sentence 4: Is that(2/2) hard power(1/1) with a human face ?

Sentence 5: Soft(1/1) power(1/1) in a flak jacket ?

Sentence 6: Whatever it(2/2) is , it produces(1/1) an inherently attractive(2/2) narrative .

Sentence 7: I(1/1) arrived in Indonesia 11 days after the(1/1) disaster(3/3) hit , and in that day 's Jakarta Post , the capital 's chief English-language daily , I read a long and reverent(1/1) profile of the(1/1) American(1/1) pilots(1/1) bearing the headline , '' U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln Enjoys Aceh Humanitarian Mission . ''

Sentence 8: As the Bush administration tries to blunt the(1/1) hostility(1/1) fostered(1/1) by four years of swaggering belligerence(2/2) , it should think about reconfiguring Nye 's parlor-game-cum-political-theory(3/3) to its own(1/1) purposes(2/2) .

Sentence 9: We(1/1) know all too well that this(1/1) administration(2/2) does not do soft(2/2) .

Sentence 0: And this(2/2) hard-jacketed form(1/1) of persuasion may actually be more(1/1) effective(2/2) than the classic(1/1) instruments(3/3) of soft power , at least as they are embodied(1/1) in popular culture .

Sentence 1: Nye(2/2) argues that , whatever its(1/1) flaws(1/1) , our(2/2) culture(1/1) projects(1/1) the core values of '' democracy , personal freedom , upward mobility and openness . ''

Sentence 2: Well , maybe that(2/2) 's the(1/1) subtext of '' The Day After Tomorrow '' and '' The Apprentice , '' but you could make at least as good a case that our coarse(1/1) entertainment products(1/1) have proved(1/1) even more frighteningly hegemonic than our military .

Sentence 3: Of(1/1) course(1/1) we(2/2) should(1/1) have exchange programs and American libraries abroad(1/1) and all the other(1/1) tools(1/1) of public diplomacy .

Sentence 4: But it(1/1) will not(1/1) be(1/1) easy(1/1) for even the best expressions of American culture to escape the overwhelming suspicion(3/4) that now dogs all things American .

Sentence 5: The same(3/3) is true , naturally(1/1) , of humanitarian helicopter missions(1/1) .

Sentence 6: But at least these(2/2) are acts , with an unambiguously positive(1/1) outcome(1/1) .

Sentence 7: And the use of our(1/1) immense hard(1/1) power(1/1) for soft(1/1) purposes(2/2) has the additional benefit of humanizing the fierce image inevitably projected by that power : the same military that shocks and awes can also save and heal .

Sentence 8: This(3/3) is n't true for only(1/1) our Armed Forces .

Sentence 9: Consider the example(3/3) of Singapore , a tiny country with a small(1/1) but professional military .

Sentence 0: In a car bomb attack(1/1) on an Iraqi military garrison on the site of Baghdad 's old Muthana inner-city airfield and another attack at a checkpoint on the perimeter of the heavily secured Baghdad International Airport , two Iraqi soldiers and two security guards were killed(1/1) .

Sentence 1: The(2/2) first(1/1) attack(2/2) , shortly after 7 a.m. , involved a truck packed with explosives that approached concrete barriers guarding the Australian Embassy compound in southern Baghdad .

Sentence 2: The American(1/1) command(1/1) said two Iraqis were(1/1) killed(3/4) .

Sentence 3: A spokesman for the American command , Lt. Col. James Hutton of the First Cavalry Division , said that none of the(1/1) bombers(2/2) Wednesday had reached their intended(1/1) targets(3/3) . ''

Sentence 4: While any loss of life(1/1) is tragic , it(2/2) could have been a lot worse(2/2) , '' he(1/1) said .

Sentence 5: Nevertheless , at the worst(1/1) of the bombing sites(2/2) there were deep craters , pools of blood , scattered human remains and shattered buildings .

Sentence 6: Near the Rafidain bank in the Etifiyah neighborhood of north-central Baghdad , where a bomb(2/2) went off as policemen lined up for their salaries , a crumpled child 's bicycle lay near the center of the blast ; people(1/1) there said a boy had been killed .

Sentence 7: The new United States-trained Iraqi Army , National Guard and police force have had hundreds(1/1) of men killed(3/3) in the past year .

Sentence 8: Now , American election plans depend on these(1/1) forces(2/2) protecting(2/2) more than 5,500 polling places .

Sentence 9: The insurgents ' threats(2/2) to(1/1) Iraqis seen as working for or alongside the Americans were demonstrated on Wednesday in a video posted on an Islamic militant Web site of the killing(1/1) of two Iraqi telecommunications technicians .

Sentence 0: Nine(1/1) current(1/1) and(1/1) former(1/1) sales(1/1) executives(1/1) from an(1/1) assortment(2/2) of(2/2) food(2/2) companies(2/2) were charged(1/1) yesterday with participating in a scheme that created a(1/1) huge(3/4) accounting(3/4) fraud(3/4) at U.S. Foodservice , which has been under investigation in the United States and in the Netherlands for the last two years .

Sentence 1: The(2/2) executives(3/3) were arraigned in Federal District Court in Manhattan on conspiracy(3/3) charges(3/3) and released(1/1) .

Sentence 2: They(3/3) worked for companies that sold products like sugar , eggs , seafood and cake mix to U.S. Foodservice , which in turn supplied restaurants , corporate dining rooms and other(1/1) institutions(1/1) .

Sentence 3: All the executives(2/2) are accused of approving documents that claimed U.S. Foodservice , a unit of Royal Ahold , was owed millions(2/2) of(2/2) dollars(2/2) more(1/1) in promotional(1/1) allowances(1/1) -- a type of rebate offered by manufacturers to stores and distributors -- than(1/1) was(1/1) actually(1/1) the(1/1) case(1/1) .

Sentence 4: The(2/2) scheme(3/3) had the effect of inflating(3/3) U.S.(3/4) Foodservice(3/4) 's(3/4) profits(3/4) , prosecutors(1/1) say .

Sentence 5: The(2/2) letters(3/3) were(1/1) issued(2/2) by a former U.S. Foodservice chief marketing officer , Mark P. Kaiser , according to court(1/1) documents(1/1) .

Sentence 6: Mr.(2/2) Kaiser(2/2) is awaiting(1/1) trial(1/1) on(1/1) conspiracy(3/3) and(3/3) fraud(3/3) charges(3/3) , along with Michael J. Resnick , the former(1/1) chief(1/1) financial(1/1) officer(1/1) .

Sentence 7: Two other former U.S. Foodservice executives , Timothy J. Lee and William F. Carter , pleaded(1/1) guilty(1/1) to similar(3/3) charges(3/3) last summer .

Sentence 8: All(1/1) the(1/1) defendants(2/2) charged(1/1) yesterday signed audit letters containing false(2/2) information(2/2) at the(1/1) request(1/1) of Mr.(1/1) Kaiser(1/1) , the(1/1) documents(2/2) state . ''

Sentence 9: Their(3/3) motivation(1/1) was to maintain a(1/1) very(2/2) important(2/2) business(2/2) relationship(2/2) , '' the acting United States attorney for Manhattan , David N. Kelley , said .

Sentence 0: President Bush arrived(1/1) in office so profoundly opposed(3/3) to peacekeeping that he scarcely bothered(1/1) with post-conflict(1/1) planning in Iraq .

Sentence 1: He(1/1) has , however , lived to rue(2/2) that(2/2) decision(1/1) .

Sentence 2: And he(3/3) has not withdrawn(2/2) American peacekeepers from the(1/1) ongoing(1/1) NATO(1/1) operation(2/2) in Kosovo .

Sentence 3: Of course , you ca n't get much publicity value from an(1/1) operation(1/1) scarcely anyone knows about .

Sentence 4: And(1/1) in any case peacekeepers ca(1/1) n't(1/1) cure what(1/1) ails(1/1) Kosovo in the way that air-dropped medical supplies can solve the(1/1) immediate(1/1) problems(2/2) of Aceh .

Sentence 5: But I(1/1) would(2/2) n't(2/2) simply(1/1) dismiss(1/1) the(2/2) soft-power(1/1) virtues(1/1) of peacekeeping .

Sentence 6: Last year I(1/1) spent(1/1) a(1/1) day(1/1) on(1/1) patrol(1/1) with the(1/1) American contingent in Kosovo .

Sentence 7: I(1/1) had(1/1) been(1/1) told(1/1) that the(2/2) Americans(1/1) never unshouldered their weapons , doffed their wraparound sunglasses , broke formation and so(1/1) on(1/1) .

Sentence 8: And yet(1/1) the squad leader , Staff Sgt. Mike Chirdon , a 32-year-old carpenter from Altoona , Pa. , passed an hour teaching an impromptu civics class in a(2/2) school(1/1) he regularly visited and then hung out in a(1/1) cafe to glean intelligence(1/1) from the locals(1/1) .

Sentence 9: Neither the Italian nor the French soldiers I also spent time(1/1) with had anything like the(2/2) relationship(1/1) with ordinary people that Chirdon had ; he was a wildly(1/1) popular figure .

Sentence 0: The(2/2) corps(3/3) has had a(1/1) much(3/3) lower(3/3) profile(3/3) and has enjoyed some(1/1) construction(3/4) successes(2/2) in Iraq .

Sentence 1: Its(3/3) electrical(3/3) projects(3/3) have added more than 1,800 megawatts to the Iraqi grid , roughly the equivalent of two large power plants .

Sentence 2: But major corps(1/1) projects , like huge(1/1) waterway(1/1) projects(1/1) in the United States , have(1/1) also(1/1) been(1/1) criticized(1/1) as grandiose(1/1) and unresponsive to local(2/2) needs(2/2) .

Sentence 3: And it was the Army corps that awarded(1/1) Halliburton(1/1) an(1/1) early(1/1) no-bid(1/1) contract(1/1) worth billions of dollars for work on Iraq 's oil fields , which opened(1/1) the(1/1) company(1/1) to(1/1) lashing(3/3) criticism(3/3) .

Sentence 4: Whether the(1/1) corps(2/2) will fare(2/2) better(2/2) than the(2/2) project(2/2) office(2/2) is open to question , Mr.(2/2) Barton(2/2) said .

Sentence 5: Success(2/2) in(1/1) Iraq(1/1) means engaging(2/2) the(1/1) local(1/1) populace(1/1) , he(3/3) said , and '' that has(1/1) n't(1/1) been(1/1) their(2/2) strength(2/2) even(1/1) domestically(1/1) . ''

Sentence 6: Brig. Gen. Thomas Bostick , commander of the Army corps in the Persian Gulf region , said that because the(1/1) two(3/3) organizations(3/3) had(1/1) been(1/1) working(1/1) hand-in-glove(1/1) from the(1/1) start(1/1) , he did not regard the(3/3) switch(3/3) as a substantial change .

Sentence 7: Rather(1/1) , he(3/3) said , the(2/2) project(2/2) office(2/2) , with its emphasis on planning , will slim(1/1) down(1/1) as more contracts moved into construction . ''

Sentence 8: I see this(3/3) as a(1/1) natural(1/1) progression(1/1) , '' General(2/2) Bostick(2/2) said . ''

Sentence 9: To say it(3/3) 's going to change , and is going to change as a result of negative(1/1) perception(1/1) , is(2/2) not(2/2) correct(2/2) . ''

Sentence 0: Just weeks after losing(2/2) his world-famous(2/2) winery(1/1) , Robert Mondavi is going back into the wine business , briefly(1/1) , with a surprising(3/3) partner -- his brother Peter .

Sentence 1: It(2/2) will be a small(1/1) venture(1/1) .

Sentence 2: But it(1/1) will be the first public collaboration(1/1) of the(1/1) two(3/3) nonagenarians(2/2) since a legendary(2/2) dispute(2/2) some 40 years ago that prompted Robert to split with his family and start his own business .

Sentence 3: Together , Robert , 92 , and Peter , 90 , will(1/1) produce(1/1) a(1/1) small barrel of wine -- 60 magnums to be exact -- to be sold next summer at the Napa Valley Auction , the California wine world 's premier social event .

Sentence 4: The lighthearted venture(2/2) , arranged by the brothers(1/1) ' winemaking sons , is heavy with symbolism(3/3) , coming as it does so soon after the implosion of the Robert Mondavi Winery and its subsequent sale to Constellation Brands late last year for about $ 1 billion .

Sentence 5: It(2/2) represents a formal healing of a breach(3/3) that kept the(1/1) two(2/2) branches(1/1) of the(1/1) renowned(1/1) wine(1/1) family(2/2) apart for almost half a century and it represents , too , a recognition that while the two factions may have stood for different(1/1) ways(1/1) of(1/1) winemaking(1/1) , they were in the long run , not(1/1) as(1/1) far(1/1) apart(1/1) as they once had thought .

Sentence 6: For the first time since(1/1) his(1/1) teenage(1/1) years(1/1) , Robert Mondavi has no formal(2/2) connection(3/3) to a winery .

Sentence 7: For his(2/2) brother(1/1) it(2/2) is a vindication(2/2) of(1/1) sorts(1/1) of his quieter(2/2) style(1/1) of running a major winery , in this case , the Charles Krug Winery , just up the road from the Robert Mondavi Winery in the Napa Valley .

Sentence 8: The Mondavi brothers ' father , Cesare , a grape shipper in the Central Valley , bought Charles(1/1) Krug(1/1) in 1943 for his sons to run(1/1) .

Sentence 9: The(2/2) sons(3/3) bickered(1/1) over how(1/1) to(1/1) run(1/1) the(2/2) business(2/2) , culminating in the 1965 altercation(1/1) .

Sentence 0: Some stores(1/1) tend to carry only designer(2/2) names(2/2) .

Sentence 1: Resurrection , a vintage clothing retailer with stores in Los Angeles and Lower Manhattan , was recently(2/2) the(1/1) benefactor(1/1) of Norma(1/1) Kamali(1/1) 's entire archive from the late 1960 's through the 90 's . ''

Sentence 2: We sold hundreds of pieces(1/1) of Norma Kamali , way beyond our(1/1) expectations(3/3) , '' said Katy Rodriguez , the(3/3) store(2/2) 's co-owner .

Sentence 3: The(2/2) prices(3/3) ranged from $ 150 into the thousands .

Sentence 4: On(1/1) the(1/1) other(2/2) hand(2/2) , Foley & Corinna , a Lower(1/1) East(1/1) Side(1/1) vintage retailer , prefers items(1/1) costing $ 100 or less . ''

Sentence 5: You 'll walk into a party , you 'll be the(1/1) only(1/1) one(1/1) wearing the(2/2) top(1/1) and , if you spill a glass of wine on it , you wo n't(1/1) be heartbroken(1/1) , '' said Anna Corinna , a(2/2) co-owner(2/2) .

Sentence 6: Andrea Linett , creative director of Lucky , the shopping magazine , who has been a buyer of vintage clothing since high school , says that it is tough(3/3) to have a(1/1) eureka(2/2) moment(2/2) in a thrift shop without having a sense of fashion history . ''

Sentence 7: You have(2/2) to(2/2) have references(2/2) , '' she(2/2) said .

Sentence 8: That(3/3) knowledge(2/2) allows thrift-store shoppers to spot signature styles of designers .

Sentence 9: Without that(3/3) knowledge(2/2) , she(1/1) said , a shopper may be better(1/1) off(1/1) going to a retailer that has already edited down the(1/1) stock(1/1) .

Sentence 0: In a case(1/1) involving(1/1) John Nettle , a 45-year-old former vice president at General Mills , a letter prepared by U.S. Foodservice 's auditor stated that General Mills owed(1/1) the(1/1) company(1/1) $ 13.44 million at the end of 2001 . ''

Sentence 1: In truth and in fact , General(1/1) Mills(1/1) owed U.S.F.(1/1) less(1/1) than(1/1) $ 2.5 million , '' the(1/1) government(1/1) charged in court(1/1) documents(1/1) .

Sentence 2: Mr.(2/2) Nettle(2/2) is accused(1/1) of signing the(2/2) letter(3/3) despite the false(3/3) information(3/3) .

Sentence 3: For 2002 , he(3/3) signed a letter stating that General Mills owed(1/1) U.S.(1/1) Foodservice(1/1) $ 36.64 million , although the amount was actually less than $ 1 million , according to the(2/2) documents(3/3) . ''

Sentence 4: As Nettle(2/2) well knew , the $ 36.64 million figure was grossly(2/2) overstated(2/2) and General Mills did not owe that amount , '' the(2/2) documents(3/3) state .

Sentence 5: A lawyer for Mr.(2/2) Nettle(2/2) , William Michael , said his client '' was(2/2) pressured(3/3) into signing these(2/2) letters(2/2) and he is very sorry for what(2/2) this(2/2) has(2/2) caused(2/2) his(1/1) former(1/1) employer(1/1) as well as his family . ''

Sentence 6: He(3/3) said that Mr.(2/2) Nettle(2/2) planned to plead(2/2) guilty(2/2) .

Sentence 7: Two(1/1) of(1/1) the(1/1) defendants(3/3) have been charged with securities(1/1) fraud(1/1) and(1/1) obstruction(2/2) of(2/2) a(2/2) federal(2/2) investigation(2/2) .

Sentence 8: Mark Bailin , who was president of Rymer International Seafood , and Peter Marion , president of Maritime Seafood Processors , are accused of buying U.S. Foodservice stock in 2000 , ahead(1/1) of(1/1) the(1/1) company(1/1) 's(1/1) announcement(2/2) that it was being acquired by Royal(1/1) Ahold(1/1) .

Sentence 9: They(3/3) made about $ 1.5 million in illegal(3/3) profits(3/3) , according to court documents .

Sentence 0: The explanation(1/1) for less American government participation(2/2) than in past years -- that this(2/2) forum(2/2) came at an awkward(1/1) time just before the State of the Union address -- makes(1/1) some(1/1) sense(2/2) .

Sentence 1: And there were Americans here(3/3) , like John A. Thain , the chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange , who gently suggested that the current-account deficit(2/2) would decline if(1/1) Europe grew faster(1/1) .

Sentence 2: Some(2/2) Americans are listening(2/2) .

Sentence 3: William H. Donaldson , the chairman of the S.E.C. , gave a speech in London this week that dealt with some of the(2/2) concerns(2/2) , indicating the commission may delay enforcing rules(1/1) against foreign companies that trade in the United States and may make it easier for foreign companies already registered in the United States to withdraw(1/1) .

Sentence 4: The(1/1) rule(1/1) that has both American and foreign companies complaining is Section(1/1) 404(1/1) , which requires extensive reviews of internal controls in companies to assure they are effective(1/1) -- and says outside auditors must certify(1/1) the controls . ''

Sentence 5: It(3/3) was an enormous(1/1) , expensive(1/1) exercise , '' Mr. Vasella said in an interview . ''

Sentence 6: It(3/3) raised the question , for my(1/1) employees , ` Is the(1/1) trust(3/3) broken(1/1) ? '

Sentence 7: because(1/1) you(2/2) control everything(1/1) . ''

Sentence 8: Novartis(1/1) has complied(2/2) with the(1/1) rule(2/2) .

Sentence 9: The chief executive of PricewaterhouseCoopers , Samuel A. DiPiazza Jr. , estimated that 10 percent of large(1/1) American companies would fail to comply(3/3) this year , either because they could not complete the work(1/1) on time or because material problems(1/1) were found .

Sentence 0: It(2/2) is also unusual in that it(1/1) seeks(1/1) to(1/1) prevent(1/1) Mr. Salinas Pliego , who owns a controlling stake in the(1/1) company(2/2) , from acting as an officer or director of TV Azteca or any other public company .

Sentence 1: If the(1/1) S.E.C.(1/1) is victorious , it would have try to find ways to restrict(2/2) Mr.(2/3) Salinas(2/3) Pliego(2/3) from(1/1) exercising(1/1) control(1/1) by voting his shares , perhaps by putting his stock in a trust , people(3/3) close(3/3) to(2/2) the(2/2) agency(2/2) say .

Sentence 2: The(2/2) action(3/3) also highlights a(1/1) trend(1/1) of the S.E.C. 's trying to enforce United States securities laws against foreign companies whose stocks and bonds are listed on American markets . ''

Sentence 3: Geographic(2/2) boundaries(2/2) will(1/1) not(1/1) serve(1/1) to(1/1) protect(1/1) those(1/1) who(1/1) seek(1/1) to(1/1) defraud(1/1) investors(1/1) , '' said Spencer C. Barasch , associate district administrator at the(1/1) S.E.C.(1/1) '' When companies , domestic or foreign , avail themselves of our capital markets , they have the same responsibility to adhere to U.S. securities law . ''

Sentence 4: TV(1/1) Azteca(1/1) , whose depository shares(1/1) trade(1/1) on the New York Stock Exchange , is a unit of Azteca Holdings , which is(1/1) controlled(1/1) by(1/1) Mr.(1/1) Salinas(1/1) Pliego(1/1) .

Sentence 5: TV Azteca is one of the(1/1) fastest-growing(3/3) Spanish-language(1/1) networks(1/1) in the United States , reaching some 77 percent of Latino homes .

Sentence 6: The S.E.C. also filed(3/4) suit(3/4) against Pedro Padilla Longoria , the former chief executive of TV Azteca , and Luis J. Echarte Fernández , president and chief of Azteca America and chief financial officer of Grupo(1/1) Salinas(1/1) .

Sentence 7: Both(3/3) men(3/3) are directors(1/1) of(1/1) TV(2/2) Azteca(2/2) .

Sentence 8: Mr.(2/2) Echarte(2/2) Fernández(2/2) paid a civil(1/1) penalty(1/1) of $ 200,000 to settle(2/2) with(1/1) the(2/3) agency(3/4) .

Sentence 9: He(3/3) neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing(1/1) .

Sentence 0: If you 're looking for guidance in terms of what the relationship is likely to be between the religious faith , Islam , and the secular side of the house , the(2/2) government(2/2) , you really need to look(1/1) at(1/1) the(1/1) top(1/1) cleric(1/1) , Sistani(1/1) , '' Mr. Cheney said . ''

Sentence 1: He(3/3) also has been very clear , from the very beginning(2/2) , that he did not want to play a(1/1) direct(1/1) role(1/1) and does(1/1) n't(1/1) believe(1/1) clerics should play a direct role in the day-to-day(1/1) operations(1/1) of government . ''

Sentence 2: As officials here(2/2) monitor the(2/2) election(2/2) returns , Mr. Rumsfeld declined(1/1) to set any schedule for withdrawing(2/2) the 150,000 American troops .

Sentence 3: He(1/1) said any exit(3/3) strategy(2/2) would be based on conditions on the ground -- including the size of the(1/1) insurgency , Syrian and Iranian help in combating it , and whether Iraqi '' fence sitters '' joined the(1/1) political process -- rather than a specific date .

Sentence 4: Mr. Rumsfeld also spelled out in greater(3/3) detail(1/1) than before the abilities(1/1) of the 136,000 Iraqi police and military personnel that the Pentagon has said are trained and equipped .

Sentence 5: Until(2/2) recently(3/3) , defense officials had given scant details on the(1/1) abilities(1/1) of individual Iraqi units .

Sentence 6: Last week , Gen. Richard B. Myers , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said 40,000 of those(3/3) Iraqi(2/2) forces(2/2) were able to handle the(1/1) most(3/3) challenging(2/2) missions(2/2) .

Sentence 7: But Mr. Rumsfeld said Sunday that that(3/3) did not mean the(2/2) remaining(3/3) security(2/2) forces(2/2) were ill-prepared(2/2) . ''

Sentence 8: Some(1/1) of(1/1) them(3/3) are trained to be policemen , and now a policeman is not a counterterrorism , or a police commando , '' he(2/2) said on CNN 's '' Late Edition . '' ''

Sentence 9: There are about 7 or 8 or 10 different categories(2/2) that are(1/1) being(1/1) trained(1/1) to do very different things(2/2) . ''

Sentence 0: Awash in cash(1/1) and practically debt(1/1) free(1/1) , Royal(1/1) Philips(1/1) Electronics(1/1) said Thursday that it would buy back up to 750 million euros ( $ 978 million ) of its own stock this year and search(1/1) for(1/1) acquisition(1/1) targets(1/1) even as a(1/1) previous(2/2) purchase(1/1) put a(1/1) dent(2/2) in its fourth-quarter earnings .

Sentence 1: Philips , the Dutch health care and technology concern , said a 16.7 percent decline in its fourth-quarter profit , to 498 million euros , was a result of a significant(2/2) write-down(1/1) of its stake in MedQuist , a medical transcription company that is the subject of class-action lawsuits and investigations by securities regulators .

Sentence 2: Philips(2/2) 's fourth-quarter sales rose 2 percent , to 9.18 billion euros , compared with the same period a year earlier .

Sentence 3: Both its(3/3) sales and net profit results(2/2) exceeded many analysts ' expectations(2/2) .

Sentence 4: Philips(1/1) had announced the MedQuist(1/1) write-down of 576 million euros last November , and it was one of only a(1/1) few(1/1) negative(1/1) notes(1/1) in otherwise upbeat(2/2) annual results .

Sentence 5: For the year , net profits at Philips(1/1) rose more than 300 percent to 2.84 billion euros ( $ 3.7 billion ) compared with 695 million euros the year before .

Sentence 6: Operating(2/2) profit(3/3) was 1.6 billion euros compared with 488 million euros in 2003 .

Sentence 7: Sales(3/3) increased(1/1) 4.5 percent , to 30.3 billion euros .

Sentence 8: The results(3/3) for Philips(1/1) and its plan to buy back(1/1) shares drove its share price up 4.45 percent , to 19.50 euros .

Sentence 9: Jan Hommen , the chief financial officer , said that Philips(1/1) believed(1/1) its stock was undervalued(2/3) . ''

Sentence 0: The treasures and the ordinary from those(3/3) donations(2/2) all went to the thrift shops ' racks .

Sentence 1: Now(2/2) , many thrift shops have specialists who pull(1/1) out(1/1) the best(1/1) offerings before they hit the floor . ''

Sentence 2: I have(1/1) not(2/2) been(1/1) in a thrift shop in probably eight years , '' Ms.(1/1) Raymond(1/1) said . ''

Sentence 3: I(1/1) rely(1/1) on people(1/1) who find the(2/2) good(2/2) stuff(3/3) , so they come to me with 300 things to choose from that have been picked with quality in mind . ''

Sentence 4: Not all old garments qualify(2/2) as vintage clothing worth buying .

Sentence 5: Ms. Raymond says the(3/3) term(2/2) befits clothing that symbolizes an entire decade or era , like Audrey Hepburn 's classic sheath dress by Givenchy from the 1950 's , or the Chanel look championed by Jackie Kennedy in the 60 's .

Sentence 6: Patrick Michael Hughes , who teaches a course on the cultural history of clothing at the Parsons School of Design in New York , said vintage clothing was revered and desired for one(3/3) reason(3/3) . ''

Sentence 7: It(3/3) really comes down to silhouette -- primarily the shape and look -- that is very , very conscious(1/1) of the body and of construction , '' he said , citing the cut of a jacket 's shoulder or sleeve . ''

Sentence 8: It(3/3) 's rooted in a(2/2) vocabulary(1/1) that today 's clothing is not . ''

Sentence 9: Mr. Hughes says the(1/1) collectible(2/2) articles(2/2) of the future will still be(1/1) from top designers -- like Dior , Valentino , Balenciaga , Yves Saint Laurent and Halston .

Sentence 0: According to the lawsuit(1/1) , Mr.(1/1) Salinas(1/1) Pliego(1/1) failed to inform shareholders about a(2/2) complex(3/3) deal(3/3) between Unefon , TV Azteca 's phone unit , and a(1/1) company(1/1) formed by Mr. Salinas Pliego and an associate , Moises Saba .

Sentence 1: That(1/1) company , called Codisco , bought Unefon(2/2) debt(1/1) at a(2/2) deep(2/2) discount(2/2) .

Sentence 2: Four(3/3) months(3/3) later(3/3) , Mr. Salinas Pliego reaped more than $ 109 million in suspected(1/1) ill-gotten(2/2) profits(2/2) by selling the Unefon debt back , at full(2/2) price(2/2) , to TV Azteca .

Sentence 3: According to the S.E.C. , Mr.(1/1) Salinas(1/1) Pliego(1/1) not only failed to disclose the(3/3) transaction(3/3) to his board , as the law requires for any related-party transaction , but he also misrepresented(3/3) the(3/3) nature(3/3) of(3/3) the(3/3) transaction(3/3) to his board , the press and the S.E.C. '' After the resignation of TV Azteca 's U.S. legal counsel and a Dec. 24 , 2003 , New York Times article concerning the matter , Mr.(2/2) Echarte(2/2) sent an e-mail to Mr. Salinas Pliego and Mr. Padilla stating , ` The damage is done and the situation that we did n't want to explain openly is now in the hands of the press , '' ' according to the S.E.C. press release .

Sentence 4: Stephen M. Cutler , director of enforcement at the S.E.C. , said : '' Salinas(2/2) took from the(1/1) company(2/2) a(1/1) valuable(1/1) corporate(2/2) opportunity(2/2) and over a period of many(2/2) months(2/2) concealed that(1/1) transaction(2/2) in violation(1/1) of(1/1) the(1/1) U.S.(1/1) securities(1/1) laws(1/1) .

Sentence 5: The federal securities laws are designed to ensure full(1/1) and(1/1) fair(1/1) disclosure(1/1) about related party(1/1) transactions . ''

Sentence 6: Mexico 's main securities regulator , the Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de Valores , has been conducting its own investigation of the(1/1) Codisco-Unefon(3/3) affair(3/3) and has now determined that Mexican(1/1) securities(1/1) laws(1/1) were(1/1) broken(1/1) , a(1/1) top(1/1) official(1/1) said Tuesday .

Sentence 0: Both(3/3) men(2/2) said there was still time(1/1) to use(1/1) diplomacy to disarm(2/2) Iran , though Mr. Cheney said that if the current talks broke down , the(1/1) administration(1/1) would seek sanctions at the United Nations Security Council .

Sentence 1: It(1/1) was Iraq , however , and the delicate question of who will emerge in control of the country , that dominated the(3/3) comments(2/2) of both(3/3) men(3/3) .

Sentence 2: As Shiite religious parties prepare(1/1) to(1/1) take(1/1) power(1/1) in the new national assembly , senior Shiite clerics are debating how(1/1) much(1/1) of the Islamic faith should be enshrined in Iraq 's new(1/1) constitution(1/1) , which the assembly will write .

Sentence 3: A(1/1) constitution(1/1) based on Koranic(1/1) law(1/1) would sharply depart(2/2) from the transitional(1/1) law(1/1) that the Americans(1/1) enacted(1/1) .

Sentence 4: In one of four appearances on television news programs(1/1) on Sunday , Mr. Rumsfeld echoed Mr. Cheney 's cautionary words(3/3) . ''

Sentence 5: The Shia in Iraq are Iraqis , '' Mr. Rumsfeld said on the NBC News program '' Meet(1/1) the Press . '' ''

Sentence 6: They(3/3) 're not Iranians .

Sentence 7: And the idea that they(3/3) 're going to end up with a government like Iran , with a handful of mullahs controlling much of the country , I think , is unlikely(2/2) . ''

Sentence 8: But he(2/2) warned that it would be '' a terrible mistake(1/1) '' if the(2/2) new(2/2) assembly(2/2) adopted a(1/1) constitution(1/1) that denied '' half of their population(1/1) , women , the opportunity to participate(1/1) fully . ''

Sentence 9: Administration(1/1) officials(1/1) acknowledged that they would have much less(2/2) influence(1/1) over a transitional Iraqi government selected by the newly(1/1) elected assembly , but were relying in part on Ayatollah(1/1) Sistani(1/1) 's stature(2/2) to steer Iraq clear(1/1) of a government led by clerics . ''

Sentence 0: Certain religious and political groups -- Iraqis , but helped by others(1/1) -- are trying to fragment(2/3) this(2/2) country(2/2) , '' he(3/3) said . ''

Sentence 1: It 's treason if you do n't(1/1) vote(2/2) because it will arouse(1/1) a(1/1) civil(2/3) war(2/3) . ''

Sentence 2: American and Iraqi officials are desperately(1/1) trying(2/2) to(1/1) draw(1/1) Sunni Arabs , who are a fifth of the population(1/1) but who are thought to make(1/1) up(1/1) the(1/1) bulk(1/1) of the(1/1) resistance(3/3) , into the electoral process .

Sentence 3: Many Sunni political parties(1/1) are boycotting the(1/1) vote(3/3) , calling it illegitimate(2/2) .

Sentence 4: But according to an Iraqi cable television station , at least one(1/1) group(1/1) of Sunni tribes in Tikrit announced Tuesday that it would take(2/2) part(2/2) in the elections(2/2) .

Sentence 5: Officials from the International Organization for Migration announced Tuesday that more than 18,000 Iraqi expatriates in 14(1/1) countries(1/1) registered Monday to vote in Iraq 's election(1/1) .

Sentence 6: In the United States , 3,270 Iraqis registered(3/3) .

Sentence 7: Monday was the(1/1) first(1/1) day(1/1) to(1/1) register(3/3) , and the process will run through Sunday .

Sentence 8: In Baghdad on Tuesday , an American soldier was killed by a bomb(1/1) blast , and at least one member of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq , a leading Shiite political party , was killed by a suicide bombing.The familiar(2/2) residue of charred car parts and spilled motor oil littered the streets in front of the party 's headquarters . ''

Sentence 9: The(1/1) car(2/2) tried(1/1) to(1/1) burst(1/1) into the(1/1) building(3/3) but the brave(1/1) guards(1/1) faced(2/2) it , '' said Reza Jawad Taki , a party(1/1) officer .

Sentence 0: In a major shift within the much-criticized(2/2) $ 18.4 billion program to rebuild(1/1) Iraq 's physical infrastructure , the office that the Pentagon formed to oversee the effort will begin handing(1/1) its(2/2) responsibilities(2/2) over(1/1) to the United States Army Corps of Engineers over the next several months .

Sentence 1: Charles Hess , the director of the agency , the Project and Contracting Office , said in a telephone interview from Baghdad that the(1/1) change(2/2) was a(1/1) natural(2/2) evolution(2/2) .

Sentence 2: He(2/2) denied that the(1/1) move(2/2) was a response to Iraqi and American criticism that the reconstruction(2/2) effort(2/2) had focused too much on large(2/2) projects(2/2) , started up too slowly and failed to anticipate attacks by insurgents .

Sentence 3: As the United States tries to lay(1/1) the(1/1) groundwork(1/1) for a functioning Iraqi government before elections on Jan. 30 , some(1/1) criticisms(1/1) of the reconstruction program have carried a particular sting : a major goal of the reconstruction , from power plants and sewage-treatment plants to roads and fire stations , was to persuade(1/1) ordinary(1/1) Iraqis(1/1) of(1/1) the(1/1) good(1/1) will(1/1) and(1/1) competence(1/1) of(1/1) the(1/1) post-Saddam(1/1) Hussein(1/1) authorities(1/1) .

Sentence 4: While the Army(1/1) corps(1/1) has increased(1/1) electricity(1/1) output(1/1) and both(2/2) agencies(2/2) have put in place other , smaller-scale(2/2) projects(2/2) , most major(2/2) efforts(2/2) have faced major(2/2) delays(2/2) .

Sentence 5: Insurgent attacks have hit both the(1/1) projects(3/3) and the workers , prompting some(3/3) large(3/3) companies(3/3) to pull out of Iraq , sending(1/1) security(1/1) costs(1/1) skyrocketing(1/1) and forcing the elimination or scaling down of dozens(2/2) of(2/2) projects(2/2) .

Sentence 6: Mr.(1/1) Hess(1/1) defended the reconstruction(2/2) program(1/1) as successful(1/1) , given the hard(2/2) realities(2/2) of Iraq , and said the gradual shift of responsibility to(1/1) the(1/1) Army(1/1) corps(1/1) , with its history of managing construction project in conflict zones , had(1/1) long(2/2) been(2/2) envisioned(2/2) .

Sentence 7: But Rick Barton , co-director of the post-conflict reconstruction program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , said the(2/2) shift(3/3) '' is a(1/1) further(1/1) confirmation(1/1) that(1/1) the(2/2) place(3/3) is(2/2) n't(2/2) safe(2/2) . '' ''

Sentence 8: I(1/1) assume(1/1) that the Army corps feels better about going(1/1) places(2/2) that(1/1) are(1/1) just(1/1) plain(1/1) dangerous(1/1) , '' he(3/3) said .

Sentence 9: The(1/1) corps(2/2) has largely avoided the(1/1) criticism(2/2) that has dogged the(1/1) project(3/3) office(2/2) .

Sentence 0: By that(3/3) crude(2/2) yardstick(2/2) , things(2/2) are getting worse(1/1) .

Sentence 1: Jonathan Garratt , managing director of Erinys , a British security company with more than 1,000 employees here , calls Iraq '' the worst(3/3) operating environment , as far as safety goes , anywhere I 've ever(1/1) known(1/1) . ''

Sentence 2: Attacks(2/2) on coalition(1/1) forces(1/1) , infrastructure and Iraq 's nascent police and army have been running at 400 to 600 a week since last summer , with occasional spikes close to 1,000 , even if their(1/1) deadliness(2/2) has tended(1/1) to(1/1) diminish(2/2) of late .

Sentence 3: Such(3/3) violence(2/2) , of course , is not bad for Mr. Garratt 's firm(2/2) : security is Iraq 's main growth industry .

Sentence 4: Another(2/2) measure(1/1) of Iraq 's insecurity is that the drive into Baghdad from the airport includes what Mr. Garratt calls '' the most(1/1) dangerous five kilometers of road in the world , '' a stretch known for its suicide bombers and other(1/1) unappetizing intrusions(1/1) .

Sentence 5: I(1/1) had been ready(1/1) to see the(1/1) reopening(1/1) of Baghdad International Airport since my(1/1) last(2/2) visit(1/1) as a mark of progress(2/2) .

Sentence 6: But if the(1/1) road(1/1) to it(1/1) is still treacherous after 22 months of American presence , the(2/2) airport(1/1) has to go in the(1/1) negative(3/3) column(3/3) .

Sentence 7: When I(1/1) was here(2/2) before , I heard much(2/2) talk(3/3) of improvised explosive devices or I.E.D. 's , the term that the military , with its genius for acronyms , had coined for roadside bombs of local manufacture .

Sentence 8: Now(1/1) there is a whole lexicon of them(3/3) .

Sentence 9: People(2/2) talk(2/2) of V.B.I.E.D.(1/1) 's ( for vehicle-borne(1/1) ) and V.C.I.E.D.(1/1) 's ( vehicle-concealed(1/1) ) .

Sentence 0: We picked(3/3) based on the best(1/1) value(1/1) for the(2/2) mission(2/2) , '' Mr. Young said in a Pentagon briefing . ''

Sentence 1: There are no political influences(1/1) on this(3/3) .

Sentence 2: I(1/1) was not asked by anyone to pick a particular one(2/2) . ''

Sentence 3: To emphasize the(2/2) point(2/2) , Mr. Young added , '' No one at the White House contacted(1/1) me . ''

Sentence 4: The selection of a new presidential helicopter fleet -- the helicopters are designated Marine One when the president is on board -- took on new urgency after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , when more(1/1) communications equipment was added to the existing fleet , making the current models heavier and less maneuverable , especially at low altitudes .

Sentence 5: The new helicopters will be able to carry more(2/2) weight , and fly(1/1) farther(3/3) and(2/2) faster(2/2) than the ones that currently ferry the president . ''

Sentence 6: This(2/2) announcement(2/2) is a strong endorsement(2/2) of a two-way street with Europe(1/1) , '' said Richard Aboulafia , an analyst with the Teal Group , an aerospace research firm in northern Virginia . ''

Sentence 7: It is , however , hard to deny that politics played a(1/1) role(2/2) when the(1/1) winner(3/3) is two of the United States ' Iraq War allies(1/1) and you have a case of Connecticut versus Texas . ''

Sentence 8: The other(2/2) lead player in the Lockheed team(2/2) is Bell Helicopter , which is based in Amarillo , Tex. .

Sentence 9: Lobbying(2/2) for the Lockheed-AgustaWestland team(1/1) took place at the(1/1) highest(2/2) levels(3/3) .

Sentence 0: When you wear them(3/3) , you feel better(1/1) , in the way they fit(1/1) and the way they feel(1/1) . ''

Sentence 1: The(2/2) ''(2/2) Biz(3/3) ''(3/3) suit(3/3) , however , is the(1/1) ultimate(2/2) showstopper(1/1) . ''

Sentence 2: People say that when I wear it(3/3) , I have a bit more sass(1/1) in my walk , '' she(1/1) said . ''

Sentence 3: And I(1/1) do(2/2) . ''

Sentence 4: QUICK READ If you want to start buying women 's vintage clothing -- whether or not it comes with a designer name -- here are some(2/2) considerations(3/3) .

Sentence 5: BUDGET Clothing found at estate sales may set(1/1) you(1/1) back(1/1) only a few dollars , but garments sold at vintage boutiques may run into the hundreds(1/1) and(1/1) even(1/1) thousands(1/1) of(1/1) dollars(1/1) .

Sentence 6: BODY TYPE Many vintage garments were designed in small(1/1) sizes .

Sentence 7: Try(2/2) on a variety of garments in different sizes from different time periods .

Sentence 8: Check(2/2) the(1/1) seams(1/1) to determine whether a visit to a(1/1) tailor(1/1) will be worthwhile(1/1) .

Sentence 9: GARMENT CONDITION That(2/2) stylish(1/1) vintage(1/1) frock(1/1) may have more than just your name all over it : there may also be perspiration stains , fade marks and pulled threads .

Sentence 0: We(1/1) 'll all be in(2/2) the(2/2) dark(2/2) .

Sentence 1: We(1/1) wo n't know(1/1) much(1/1) because it(3/3) is all classified(1/1) . ''

Sentence 2: This(3/3) is the(1/1) second(3/3) big blow to Sikorsky .

Sentence 3: Last year , it(3/3) lost a $ 39 billion Pentagon contract when the Comanche helicopter program was cancelled(2/2) . ''

Sentence 4: Sikorsky and our All-American(1/1) supplier team are disappointed(1/1) with this(3/3) outcome(2/2) , '' said Stephen N. Finger , Sikorsky 's president . ''

Sentence 5: We(2/2) 're honored to have flown U.S. presidents for nearly half a century . ''

Sentence 6: Sikorsky is perhaps best known as maker of the Black Hawk helicopter , a military war horse that is in heavy use(1/1) in Iraq .

Sentence 7: The VH-92 offering(1/1) being designed by Sikorsky is a variant(2/2) of its new S-92 midsized helicopter that the company is making with international(1/1) partners(2/2) .

Sentence 8: The fact that the VH-92(1/1) could trace its lineage to a foreign design caused some on the Lockheed side(1/1) to claim that Sikorsky was not playing(1/1) fair by calling its craft(1/1) all-American .

Sentence 9: At the Sikorsky plant in Stratford , the(2/2) Pentagon(2/2) decision(3/3) was greeted glumly(1/1) .

Sentence 0: Senator Charles E. Schumer , the New York Democrat , said yesterday that he had spoken to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell '' to get them to use(1/1) their influence to secure Lockheed(2/2) the(1/1) contract(2/2) . ''

Sentence 1: And Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , Democrat of New York , who had flown in Marine One as first lady , personally telephoned Mr. Blair before a recent meeting with President Bush to urge(1/1) him to press(1/1) for Lockheed(3/3) .

Sentence 2: Senator Clinton was at the plant in Owego , N.Y. , where Lockheed will make part of the(1/1) craft(2/2) , yesterday and called(1/1) the presidential helicopter an '' Oval(1/1) Office(1/1) in the sky . ''

Sentence 3: Many(3/3) in Congress opposed to Lockheed 's international team argued that the president should be ferried only(1/1) in a helicopter that was American designed and made .

Sentence 4: To quell those(2/2) concerns(2/2) , Lockheed lined up a roster of suppliers around the country and committed itself to making the(1/1) airframes(2/2) in Texas .

Sentence 5: It(3/3) also agreed(1/1) to set up a new plant(2/2) in upstate New York and spread(1/1) work(1/1) to companies(1/1) in California and New England .

Sentence 6: On the Sikorsky side(2/2) , many(1/1) members of Congress who had lobbied for it(1/1) expressed bitter(1/1) disappointment(1/1) with the(2/2) decision(2/2) . ''

Sentence 7: Made in America should mean(1/1) something(1/1) , '' said Rosa L. DeLauro , a Democratic representative from Stratford , Conn. , as she stood outside the Sikorsky(1/1) plant(2/2) there(1/1) . ''

Sentence 8: The Defense Department has(1/1) some explaining(1/1) to do . ''

Sentence 9: And Duncan Hunter , a California Republican who is a staunch '' Buy(1/1) America(1/1) ''(1/1) proponent(1/1) and serves as chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , deplored the(2/2) decision(2/2) . ''

Sentence 0: While some Democrats are still struggling to find their(1/1) voices(2/2) after November 's election losses(2/2) , Senator Barbara Boxer of California is not(1/1) among them .

Sentence 1: Her full-throated and combative questioning(1/1) of Condoleezza(1/1) Rice(1/1) during two days of hearings on her nomination to be secretary of state was a vivid illustration of the aggressive(1/1) posture that Ms. Boxer , a 64-year-old liberal from Marin County , near San Francisco , brought back to Washington after rolling up a(1/1) big(1/1) margin(1/1) of victory in her re-election to a third term .

Sentence 2: Before casting one of two Democratic votes against Ms. Rice on the Foreign Relations Committee -- the other was John Kerry 's -- Ms. Boxer explained bluntly why(2/2) she had been so persistent in pressing(1/1) the(1/1) national(1/1) security(1/1) adviser(1/1) on what Ms. Boxer portrayed as the administration 's misleading(3/3) and(3/3) misguided(3/3) rationale(2/2) for the war in Iraq . ''

Sentence 3: The fact is we 've lost(1/1) so many(2/2) lives(1/1) over it(3/3) , '' she(2/2) said . ''

Sentence 4: So if we(1/1) do get a little testy(1/1) on the(1/1) point(2/2) , and I admit to be so , it 's because it(3/3) continues day in and day out , and 25 percent of the(2/2) dead(3/3) are from California .

Sentence 5: We(2/2) can not forget(2/2) .

Sentence 6: We(2/2) can not forget that(3/3) . ''

Sentence 7: Her(3/3) jousting(2/2) with Ms. Rice made her the most outspoken foe(1/1) in the hearings(3/3) .

Sentence 8: And it(3/3) came after Ms. Boxer earlier this month joined a handful(1/1) of House Democrats in forcing(1/1) a debate on the legitimacy of the presidential electoral votes from Ohio ; she was the only senator to vote to challenge(1/1) Ohio 's votes .

Sentence 9: It is clear(1/1) that she(3/3) is interpreting her easy win in November , when she accumulated the third-largest number of votes in the nation , behind only the presidential contenders , as a mandate(1/1) of her own . ''

Sentence 0: DIANA COSTALES , a collector of vintage clothing , loves to describe a find at an estate sale shortly after she moved to Albuquerque seven years ago : five women 's suits from the 1940 's -- '' some very dressy(1/1) , some pretty(1/1) casual(1/1) , '' she said . ''

Sentence 1: But what was so amazing about them(3/3) was they were all perfect(2/2) , hanging in dry-cleaner bags , '' Ms. Costales added . ''

Sentence 2: There was(1/1) n't(1/1) a button missing(2/2) , not a thread pulled , not a stain .

Sentence 3: It was like(1/1) time forgot them(3/3) . ''

Sentence 4: Hard(1/1) to forget , however , was the(1/1) price(1/1) : just $ 2 apiece(1/1) . ''

Sentence 5: Half of(1/1) it(2/2) 's the hunt , and the other half 's finding that really great deal , '' said Ms. Costales , a stay-at-home mother and manager of investment property .

Sentence 6: These days , the(1/1) growing(1/1) popularity(1/1) of collecting and wearing vintage clothing has made those(2/2) $(1/1) 2(1/1) deals(1/1) harder to come by , as shoppers become as knowledgeable about top designers as retailers and wholesalers . ''

Sentence 7: Some vintage shop owners , if they 're going to the same estate sales , wo n't share information(1/1) because you , the shopper , are their competition(1/1) , '' said Ms. Costales , who gave the(2/2) $(2/2) 2(2/2) suits(2/2) to her older sister .

Sentence 8: The business of vintage clothing has(1/1) changed(2/2) considerably since the late 1960 's , when small shops popped up to accommodate young buyers looking for fashion alternatives(1/1) , said Doris Raymond , the owner of The Way We Wore , a store in Los Angeles .

Sentence 9: When she(2/2) opened(1/1) her first store(1/1) , in 1981 in San Francisco , most people who wore vintage clothes bought them at thrift shops , which often received donations from estates .

Sentence 0: Louis Webre , vice president for marketing and media at Doyle New York , an auction house , said that over the last four years , more(3/3) people(1/1) were participating in its spring and fall '' Couture , Textiles and Accessories '' auctions , which include vintage clothing .

Sentence 1: The event that steered(2/2) vintage couture sales in a new direction , creating a huge(2/2) upswing in auction attendance , he(3/3) said , was the 2001 Academy Awards .

Sentence 2: Julia Roberts attended the(3/3) ceremonies(2/2) in a vintage Valentino dress , while Renée Zellweger arrived in a canary yellow chiffon number , circa 1960 , by Jean Desses .

Sentence 3: A(2/2) stylist(2/2) had bought the(2/2) Desses(2/2) dress(2/2) at a Doyle auction for a bid '' in the four figures , '' although Mr.(1/1) Webre(1/1) said that vintage couture '' can cost you well into the five figures . ''

Sentence 4: Rachel Zoe Rosenzweig , a Los Angeles stylist , found(2/2) a one-shouldered orange Valentino dress from the 1970 's that Jennifer Garner , one of her clients , wore to the 2004 Academy Awards . ''

Sentence 5: For some(1/1) actresses(1/1) , high-end(1/1) vintage(1/1) evokes an idea of old Hollywood , because their idols and fashion icons were wearing those(1/1) very(1/1) designers(1/1) these celebrities want(1/1) to wear now , '' Ms. Rosenzweig said .

Sentence 6: Sometimes , she(1/1) noted , these(3/3) gowns(2/2) are on loan from the archives of designers(1/1) .

Sentence 7: But actresses often(1/1) buy their(1/1) own(1/1) gowns(1/1) from high-end vintage boutiques .

Sentence 8: The(3/3) clothing(2/2) , she(2/2) added , does(1/1) n't(1/1) have(1/1) to(1/1) be(1/1) expensive . ''

Sentence 9: I have gotten(1/1) evening gowns for myself and my(2/2) clients(3/3) that have been under $ 100 that look as if they cost several thousand dollars -- but they do n't have a designer name in them , '' she(3/3) said .

Sentence 0: The Bush administration sought Sunday(1/1) to allay(3/3) concerns(2/2) that a Shiite religious state could emerge in Iraq as a result of last weekend 's elections(2/2) .

Sentence 1: Speaking on television news programs on Sunday , Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said that Iraq 's most influential Shiite cleric , Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani , opposed(1/1) direct cleric involvement in daily(1/1) governing(2/2) , and that most(1/1) Iraqis rejected an Iranian-style(1/1) theocracy(1/1) . ''

Sentence 2: We(1/1) have a great(1/1) deal of confidence in where(1/1) they(3/3) 're headed(1/1) , '' Mr. Cheney said on '' Fox News Sunday . '' ''

Sentence 3: I do n't think , at(1/1) this(2/2) stage(2/2) , that there 's anything like justification for hand-wringing(1/1) or(1/1) concern(1/1) on the part of Americans that somehow they(3/3) 're going to produce a result(1/1) we(1/1) wo n't like . ''

Sentence 4: He added , '' The Iraqis have watched the Iranians operate for years(1/1) and create a religious theocracy that has been a dismal(1/1) failure(2/2) , from the standpoint of the rights(1/1) of individuals . ''

Sentence 5: In his interview , Mr. Cheney also elaborated(1/1) , for the first time , on the meaning of President Bush 's challenge(3/3) to the Iranian people to rise up against their ruling clerics .

Sentence 6: In the State of the Union address , Mr. Bush said , '' As you(3/3) stand for your own liberty , America(1/1) stands(1/1) with(1/1) you . ''

Sentence 7: Pressed to say what , exactly , the United States would(2/2) do(3/3) , Mr. Cheney said he and Mr. Bush '' wanted to encourage(1/1) the(2/2) efforts(3/3) that we 've seen(1/1) previously(1/1) in Iran to promote freedom and democracy . ''

Sentence 8: The(3/3) statement(2/2) ,(1/1) he said , was intended '' to encourage the reformers , if you will , inside Iran to work to build a true democracy , one that does n't vest enormous power , as this(1/1) one does , in the unelected mullahs , who , we believe , are a(2/2) threat(3/3) to peace and stability in the(2/2) region(1/1) . ''

Sentence 9: Both Mr. Cheney and Mr. Rumsfeld addressed Iran 's nuclear ambitions , with Mr. Rumsfeld saying in a CBS News interview that he thought Iran '' could be some(2/2) period(3/3) of(1/1) years(2/2) off(2/2) '' from actually building a nuclear weapon .

Sentence 0: Nye himself once told me(1/1) Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld 's response to the(2/2) concept : '' I do n't know what ` soft power ' is . ''

Sentence 1: President Bush 's chintzy(1/1) initial response(2/2) to the(1/1) tsunami(1/1) implies that he does n't know quite what it(3/3) is either .

Sentence 2: The problem(1/1) with the hard-soft(1/1) dichotomy(2/2) itself is that it fails to take account of the soft-power potential(2/2) of military helicopters and aircraft carriers .

Sentence 3: We(1/1) live in an era not only of globalized information but also(1/1) of the nearly $ 450 billion defense budget .

Sentence 4: The United States military is now an instrument(1/1) of absolutely everything -- warfare , diplomacy , social policy , humanitarianism .

Sentence 5: It(1/1) just depends how(1/1) we deploy it(2/2) .

Sentence 6: The critical attributes that make the U.S.S.(2/2) Abraham(2/2) Lincoln(2/2) an instrument of persuasion rather than of coercion are , first , that it is being put to nonlethal use(1/1) and , second and no less important , that it is advancing(2/2) humanitarian(1/1) ends(2/2) -- that it is not directly serving American self-interest . ''

Sentence 7: This(3/3) was an act of God , '' the Jakarta Post reporter quotes an American serviceman . ''

Sentence 8: We(2/2) are here and happy to help(2/2) . ''

Sentence 9: Soft power , in short , need(2/2) not(1/1) be(1/1) squishy(1/1) soft(2/2) .

Sentence 0: The(1/1) video(2/2) showed the(2/2) men(3/3) , still alive , posed in front of a black banner emblazoned with the name of an Islamic terrorist group , Ansar al Sunna , that has claimed responsibility for many of the most brutal attacks of the(1/1) war(3/3) in the past year .

Sentence 1: They(3/3) were then shown(1/1) crouching before a stone wall , blindfolded , as their executioner approached from off camera and killed(2/2) them with pistol shots to the back of the head .

Sentence 2: Earlier(3/3) , the men(2/2) confessed(1/1) that they had been sent to the northern cities of Mosul and Erbil on an American contract to install computer communications for the elections(2/2) .

Sentence 3: At least 11 other(1/1) people(1/1) were killed(3/4) on Wednesday .

Sentence 4: Gunmen(1/1) who attacked(2/2) the Baghdad offices of a major Kurdish party , the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan , killed one party(1/1) member(1/1) and wouned(1/1) others(1/1) , party officials said .

Sentence 5: Also(2/2) in Baghdad , another car bomb aimed(1/1) at an American convoy missed(1/1) its target but killed four Iraqi bystanders .

Sentence 6: In Hilla , 60 miles south of Baghdad , an Iraqi policeman was killed in a car bombing(1/1) , according to a(1/1) Polish military spokesman .

Sentence 7: Much(1/1) of the remaining(3/3) violence(2/2) was in northern Iraq , in Erbil , Dohuk , Kirkuk and Mosul .

Sentence 0: ARE things(3/3) getting better(1/1) or(1/1) worse in Iraq ?

Sentence 1: That(2/2) is the(1/1) basic(1/1) question(1/1) , on which much(2/2) hinges for the United States and the world .

Sentence 2: Here are some(1/1) impressionistic(2/2) answers(2/2) .

Sentence 3: Just over a year ago , on my(1/1) last visit to the(2/2) country(2/2) , I was able to drive north to Tikrit , Saddam Hussein 's home town , and south to the Shiite(1/1) holy city of Najaf .

Sentence 4: These(3/3) were not(2/2) excursions for sitting back and enjoying the scenery .

Sentence 5: But they(2/2) were feasible , at high speed and with some(1/1) risk(2/2) .

Sentence 6: Today , no(1/1) Westerner with any vestige of sanity would contemplate(1/1) making such(3/3) trips(3/3) , even in the(1/1) aftermath of an(3/3) election(3/3) that was a remarkable(1/1) success(1/1) .
