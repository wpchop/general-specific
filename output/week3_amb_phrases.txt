Sentence 0: The contracting(2/2) office(2/2) and the(1/1) projects(2/2) it finances employ about 155 government workers in Baghdad and the United States , about 250 contractors in Iraq and just over 100,000 Iraqis who work on the(1/1) construction(1/1) itself .

Sentence 1: The(1/1) contracting(2/2) office(2/2) said that 1,550 projects(1/1) were currently under way , and that $ 2.4 billion had been spent , out of $ 13.95 billion committed(1/1) specifically to reconstruction(2/2) .

Sentence 5: But one of the former(1/1) officials(1/1) said that by preventing(1/1) the project(1/1) office(1/1) from becoming a permanent government(1/1) institution , there was also a positive(2/2) slant(1/1) to the(1/1) shift(3/3) . ''
