        <p>LEAD: For the signing of their historic free trade agreement tomorrow, President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada are planning a little telephone conversation around 4 P.M. and separate ''photo opportunities.''</p>
        <p>For the signing of their historic free trade agreement tomorrow, President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada are planning a little telephone conversation around 4 P.M. and separate ''photo opportunities.''</p>
        <p>The President will be vacationing in Palm Springs, Calif., and the Prime Minister will be in Ottawa.</p>
        <p>The lack of ceremony has disappointed supporters of the hard-won treaty, who still have to gain legislative approval in both countries.</p>
        <p>''We certainly would have liked a bigger splash,'' said Julius L. Katz, senior policy analyst for the American Coalition on Trade Expansion with Canada.</p>
        <p>Since it was inconvenient for either Mr. Mulroney or Mr. Reagan to visit the other's capital, some consideration was given to a border signing ceremony. But trade officials said the President was unwilling to give up his weekend, although he is planning to discuss the free trade agreement in coming weeks, beginning with his radio address tomorrow.</p>
        <p>For American legislative reasons the agreement has to be signed on Saturday, which is 90 days after Congress was formally notified and the last day that it can be eligible for special, fast-track ratification procedures.</p>
        <p>There have been earlier efforts to arrive at comprehensive trade agreements between the two countries, but all failed for lack of support in one country or the other.</p>
        <p>The last such attempt, in 1911, failed when the government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, a liberal, was voted out of office soon after it had signed an agreement.</p>
