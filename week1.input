2005_01_14_1641804.10	Shares of Taser International , the manufacturer of stun guns whose safety has been questioned , rose more than 22 percent yesterday after the company said a newly published scientific study affirmed that the gun 's electric shocks do not cause cardiac arrest and '' may be safely applied multiple times if needed . '' The news release issued by Taser quoted directly from the study but did not list the four authors , two of whom are Taser executives . The release also said that the study was published in a prestigious peer-reviewed journal , Pacing and Clinical Electrophysiology . But the study is scheduled to appear instead in a supplement to the journal , not the journal itself . Studies in both the journal and the supplement are peer reviewed , according to Dawn Peters , a spokeswoman for the journal 's publisher , Blackwell Publishing . In a peer-reviewed journal , qualified outside researchers evaluate the findings . After the news release appeared , Taser 's stock rose sharply , closing at $ 20.80 a share , up $ 3.79 . Just two days earlier , the stock plunged $ 5.95 , or nearly 30 percent , to $ 14.10 , after the company said that sales might slow because of increased competition . The news release and the stock market response are the latest episodes in a running debate over the safety of Taser 's pistol-like stun guns , which are sold mainly to police departments but also to the military and to a few civilians . Most of Taser 's nearly $ 70 million in annual revenue comes from sales to police departments , according to the company .
