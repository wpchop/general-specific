2005_01_05_1639693.10	Securities regulators charged one of the richest men in Mexico , Ricardo B. Salinas Pliego , with fraud yesterday , in a lawsuit that seeks to have him barred as a director or officer of any company whose shares trade on an American exchange . The Securities and Exchange Commission also sought to have Mr. Salinas Pliego , the chairman of TV Azteca , the second-biggest Spanish-language broadcaster , give up more than $ 110 million he made from trading in the company 's stock and debt . The suit , filed in federal court in Washington , came after a long investigation into financial dealings between TV Azteca and a private company owned by Mr. Salinas Pliego . In the lawsuit , the commission contended that Mr. Salinas Pliego reaped '' a tremendous personal profit at the expense of investors '' in the United States and Mexico , then '' coordinated a scheme to conceal '' his involvement from them , TV Azteca 's directors and regulators . The suit charged that Mr. Salinas Pliego added to his gains by selling more than $ 9 million of stock in TV Azteca while he and other executives rejected advice from their lawyers to disclose his involvement . The transactions came to light in late 2003 after a New York lawyer , citing the Sarbanes-Oxley corporate governance law , blew the whistle to TV Azteca 's board and threatened to tell the S.E.C. . After the lawyer 's withdrawal was reported in The New York Times , two American directors commissioned an investigation into the transactions in early 2004 , and then resigned in the spring . It was later disclosed in a draft of the report of the investigation that Mr. Salinas Pliego had sought to have various law firms endorse his transactions and that the law firms refused . Mr. Salinas Pliego said in a statement late Tuesday that the S.E.C. 's charges were '' false , in bad faith and discriminatory , '' and that he would fight them . The case breaks new ground in that it is the first major instance in which a lawyer has followed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and blown the whistle on a client .

The investigation is continuing , '' upstream and downstream , '' he said . All of the executives have also been named in a civil case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission , which accuses them of aiding and abetting a financial fraud . Promotional allowances are intended to be used to help sell a manufacturer 's goods to consumers , through discounts , displays or advertising , and they often add up to large amounts of money . U.S. Foodservice would pay the price of goods up front , as part of its costs , then book promotional allowances as assets in its records , according to court documents . Exaggerating the promotional allowances , sometimes by a factor of 30 or more , not only made U.S. Foodservice look like a better business than it was , but also improved the financial appearance of its parent , Royal Ahold . Royal Ahold , a publicly traded company based in the Netherlands , revealed in February 2003 that it had overstated earnings by at least $ 500 million over the previous two years .

2005_01_14_1641845.10	In a major shift within the much-criticized $ 18.4 billion program to rebuild Iraq 's physical infrastructure , the office that the Pentagon formed to oversee the effort will begin handing its responsibilities over to the United States Army Corps of Engineers over the next several months . Charles Hess , the director of the agency , the Project and Contracting Office , said in a telephone interview from Baghdad that the change was a natural evolution . He denied that the move was a response to Iraqi and American criticism that the reconstruction effort had focused too much on large projects , started up too slowly and failed to anticipate attacks by insurgents . As the United States tries to lay the groundwork for a functioning Iraqi government before elections on Jan. 30 , some criticisms of the reconstruction program have carried a particular sting : a major goal of the reconstruction , from power plants and sewage-treatment plants to roads and fire stations , was to persuade ordinary Iraqis of the good will and competence of the post-Saddam Hussein authorities . While the Army corps has increased electricity output and both agencies have put in place other , smaller-scale projects , most major efforts have faced major delays . Insurgent attacks have hit both the projects and the workers , prompting some large companies to pull out of Iraq , sending security costs skyrocketing and forcing the elimination or scaling down of dozens of projects . Mr. Hess defended the reconstruction program as successful , given the hard realities of Iraq , and said the gradual shift of responsibility to the Army corps , with its history of managing construction project in conflict zones , had long been envisioned . But Rick Barton , co-director of the post-conflict reconstruction program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , said the shift '' is a further confirmation that the place is n't safe . '' '' I assume that the Army corps feels better about going places that are just plain dangerous , '' he said . The corps has largely avoided the criticism that has dogged the project office .

Thomas Bostick , commander of the Army corps in the Persian Gulf region , said that because the two organizations had been working hand-in-glove from the start , he did not regard the switch as a substantial change .", "Rather , he said , the project office , with its emphasis on planning , will slim down as more contracts moved into construction .
